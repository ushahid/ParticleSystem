ParticleSystem
==============

A simple particle system in C++/OpenGL


cloud: All the global functions
constants: All the constant perimeters for the system

particle: Class that handles particles movement and physics
particle_system: Class that handle particles collectively


NOTE: To compile this code you need to setup OpenGL first. If particles are moving slowly then increase DELTA or decrease number of particles.
