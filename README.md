ParticleSystem
==============

A simple particle system in C++/OpenGL


cloud: All the global functions.

constants: All the constant perimeters for the system.

particle: Class that handles movement of a single particle.

particle_system: Class that handles particles collectively.

vec3d: A class to handle basic functions of vectors in space.


NOTE: To compile this code you need to setup OpenGL first. If particles are moving slowly then increase DELTA or decrease NUMBER_OF_PARTICLES in constants.h
